* Add view and controller classes (check)
* How to deal with active labeledimage, label, segmenter (check)
* Implement save project to save all the labelings (check)
* Only save modified labelings (check)
* Initialize the labelingFile to not clash with any other labelingFile
* Discussion with Tom
  * What has been done:
    * LabkitModel is simple serialized with YAML
    * Move open image, open project & save project dialogs from LabkitController to LabkitView
    * LabkitController initializes ImageModel
  * Why should a view support multiple controller, that's nonsense
  * Relative labeling path in ImageModel
    * The labelingFile in ImageModel should be stored as relative path to the projectFolder
    * Who should initialize the labelingFile to not clash with any other labelingFile.
  * The view now changes the model, by calling ImageModel.setLabelingModified(), how do we deal with this.
* How to deal with "visibility"
  * Place label visibilities in the model.
* How to deal with pixel size / pixel display ratio
